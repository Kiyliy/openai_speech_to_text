post https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions

Transcribes audio into the input language.
Request body
file
file
Required

The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm.
model
string
Required

ID of the model to use. Only whisper-1 is currently available.
language
string
Optional

The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 format will improve accuracy and latency.
prompt
string
Optional

An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The prompt should match the audio language.
response_format
string
Optional
Defaults to json

The format of the transcript output, in one of these options: json, text, srt, verbose_json, or vtt.
temperature
number
Optional
Defaults to 0

The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.
Returns

The transcribed text.
